# MCManure - Everybody Poops!

This mod adds manure generation to various animals. The manure can be used for fertilization and can be dried in a
furnace and used for fuel.

## Cows

Cows generate manure that can be collected and used just as bone meal. In addition, cow manure can be dried in a furnace
and turned into Dried Cow Manure. One piece of dried manure is enough to dry two pieces of raw manure, so you can create
a self-sustaining fuel factory.

## Horses

Horses also produce manure and the mechanics are identical to those of cows.

## Chicken

Chicken occasionally produce manure that fertilize the ground they're standing on, as well as any plant growing on it.
